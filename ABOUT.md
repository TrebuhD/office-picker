# Office location finder

The user is presented with cards representing suggested locations.

## Bullet points

- Simple React App using TypeScript, react-spring and axios.
- Uses modern functional React with component logic extracted into custom hooks.

1. Cheap flights:

- Compare flight cost from Amsterdam/Madrid/Budapest to 3 places, e.g London, Paris, New York.

2. Weather:

- Average temperature
- Number of sunny days
- Avg. hours of sunshine

## TODO

- [✔️] Bootstrap a new project with React (CRA), TypeScript & SCSS
- [✔️] Create a simple UI using cards
- [️] Deploy online

## THINGS TO IMPROVE

- Type definitions for some external dependencies (rodal, useAnimation) should be improved.
- Caching can be enabled without extra effort by enabling the service worker. I decided not to do this for this assignment.
- More data could be added to help Jamie make his decision.
- If the app was more complicated, a state management library like Redux or Recoil.js could be used.
- Unit tests can be added.
