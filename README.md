ASSIGNMENT
--

Jamie's vacation is about to end. She works at an international company, so she can choose another office to work from: either Amsterdam, Madrid, or Budapest. Help her choose which office to go to – she’d like someplace with good weather or cheap flights (or both).

If you'd like to use an API (it's optional), you could try the AccuWeather API ( developer.accuweather.com ), the Kiwi application ( docs.kiwi.com ), or another of your choosing.

You have full control over how you want to present your data, but keep in mind this is a client-side application and Jamie needs to have enough information to make her choice. Make sure to publish your result on GitHub and provide an online demo. You can pick a framework, and the browser compatibility is up to you. We really value creativity, and we encourage you to create your own requirements while working on this assignment. It would be great if you could finish this within one week.

We recommend that you do not spend more than 4 hours on the assignment, and it is obviously not possible to implement all aspects of a production-ready application in this timeframe. This is why we suggest to focus on delivering a functional solution, while showcasing your strengths within the time indication.

Some of example focus areas are:

• Technical excellence
• Jaw-dropping UX
• Extremely secure app
• Framework guru (Vue, React or other)

We also encourage you to document your choices and possible improvement areas, in order to give us an insight in your line of thought, and help us evaluate your assignment accordingly.
